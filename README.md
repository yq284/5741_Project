Project Name: [Aviation Safety Enhancement through Predictive Analysis](https://github.com/yq284/5741_Project)

Project type: Data analysis

Group Members: Yulong Quan (yq284)

Course code: 5741

Project Description: We propose a predictive analysis project aimed at enhancing aviation safety by identifying and quantifying key risk factors that contribute to the severity of aviation accidents. Using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest model, this project will analyze historical accident data to predict the severity of potential future accidents and offer actionable insights for risk management. This initiative is crucial for improving safety protocols, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance within the aviation industry.
