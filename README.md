Project Name: [Avia0on Safety Enhancement through Predic0ve Analysis](https://github.com/yq284/5741_Project)

Project type: Data analysis

Group Members: Yulong Quan (yq284)

Course code: 5741

Project Description: We propose a predic0ve analysis project aimed at enhancing avia0on safety by iden0fying and quan0fying key risk factors that contribute to the severity of avia0on accidents. Using advanced machine learning techniques, par0cularly the Random Forest model, this project will analyze historical accident data to predict the severity of poten0al future accidents and offer ac0onable insights for risk management. This ini0a0ve is crucial for improving safety protocols, opera0onal efficiency, and regulatory compliance within the avia0on industry.
