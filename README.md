Project Description: We propose a project focused on social media sentiment analysis for brand reputation risk management. As social media continues to play an increasingly significant role in shaping public perception and brand reputation, it is essential for our company to effectively monitor and manage sentiment expressed on these platforms. This project aims to apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to analyze social media data, observe hidden trends of social media sentiment, and identify potential reputation risks associated with our brand.
